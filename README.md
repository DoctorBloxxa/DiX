# DiX
Drop-in replacement for the shitty ass instance explorer script "DeX"


# Why is it better? It has less features!

It doesn't freeze ur game for 1 minute for every little action you do lmao

# How does it run much better?

It abuses modern roblox features. DeX doesn't do so.
This script also prioritizes performance while adding quality of life features.
